    <description>
      Ever scribbled ideas on a piece of paper and drawn lines between related thoughts? Then you already know what Scapple does. It's a virtual sheet of paper that lets you make notes anywhere and connect them using lines or arrows.
      Join up your thinking however you want. Scapple doesn't force you to make connections—every note is equal, so it's up to you which notes have connections and which don't. You have complete freedom to experiment with how your ideas fit together.
      Creating notes is as easy as double-clicking anywhere on the page; making connections between ideas is as simple as dragging and dropping one note onto another. And unlike real paper, in Scapple you can move notes around and never run out of space.
